# Social-Network-Application

During the Advanced Programming Methods course, I developed a desktop application using Java which simulates a social network application, including some functionality such as registration, authentication, sending friend requests, and messages. As an admin, which is a special user, you can manage users, see a list of users paginated (you can specify the number of users per page), add, update, and delete users, or see a conversation between two users. A user can send a friend request to another user who can accept or decline it. Users can also send messages to one another. 
The application uses a layered architecture and a relational database to save persistent information. The graphical interface was created using JavaFX. 
Additionally, during testing of the application, I opened several windows for different users and implemented automatic updating of windows using the Observer pattern.
