# Social-Network-Application

During Advanced Programming Methods course I develop a desktop application using java which simulate a social newtork application including some functionality such as registration, authentication, sending friend requests and messages. As an admin, which is a special user, you can manages users, see list of users paged (you can specify the number of users per page), add, update, delete users or see conversation between 2 users. A user can send a friend request to another user who can accept or decline it. Users can also send messages to each other. 
The application uses layered architecture and relational database to save persistent information. The graphical interface was created using javaFX.
